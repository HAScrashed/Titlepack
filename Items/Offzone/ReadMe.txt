About Offzone items

Offzone#01 & Offzone#10 are dynamic items, that is not as common to edit them in case for example you would like to change the shape.
Since circular shape are not possible for dynamic items, Offzone#20 has been created from a sector, here a checkpoint, be case to avoid intersections between them, it could have bad issues.

The best to use these items is to have them into a TitlePack because they use a specific texture findable in Offzone\Visible\Textures.
