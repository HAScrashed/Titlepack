About Evolutive_Concrete items

Evolutive_Concrete is highly inspired from Essential items and Shape items.
The difference is that items contain more details / decorations on side walls mainly.
And allow more combinations between each of them.
Around 1500 items are in the pack at the moment.
Every surfaces are normally walljumpable.
The pack is destined to be update in the future to add more and more possibilities.
