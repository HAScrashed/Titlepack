About Space items

Space items has been created to fit with the Lunar Mod. Use OpenPlanet to have the best immersion !
In the Obstacle Mode, a preset map is available to start with.

The best to use these items is to have them into a TitlePack because items Asteroide & StarsAroundTheWorld use dedicated textures, without to host them, it will never works inside servers of the TitlePack.
