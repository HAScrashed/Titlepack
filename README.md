# TODO
- Remake the records system
    - Improve the database structure (using index?) to make it more efficient
    - Improve the backend for better performance/security/scalability
    - Change the way records are sent to the players (Make the http requests directly in the manialinks?)
- Start making the "obstacle pro" (sprint :D) mode
- Fix the medal unlocking in campaign
- Remake UI (remove old code and make a new one)
    - Checkpoints/Goal markers (I think there is a bug currently some cps arent shown sometimes)
    - Fully custom UI (The main problem should be re-creating the weapon gauge)
